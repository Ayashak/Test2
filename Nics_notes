no combination of credentials and MFA options passes the NA aws account idp integration for me

so instead, to be able to test the rest

1. Create personal credentials using the format 'tw.first.last'

- create your own credentials with programmatic access
- attach the AdministratorAccess managed policy directly
- add these credentials to your local aws-vault (or whatever local aws credentials management practice you follow)


Can't have default values for s3 buckets as those are global-unique names. Added '-na' to s3 name definition. 

```bash
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _backend-support.infra  # these can make use of dojo


start of interview

- generate credentials for the candidate - 'frst.last.candidate'
- select 'save to csv' option and zoom-chat the contents to candidate start of interview
- as a first step, have the candidate rotate the provided credentials




$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _base.infra

# build app artifacts, then build docker images
$ make apps
$ make docker
```

Can't use currently supported aws cli versions to login in the way the makefile does so updated to:  

aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(REPO_URL)  

Also, dojo doesn't expect to also run docker commands, yet the above makes that a bit challenging, so removed. Which basically just means that aws cli must be installed locally.  

```bash
# push images
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _push
```
Now can go ahead and deploy the specific app infra and the app itself.  

```bash
# deploy product infra and app
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make news.infra

```

Tear it all down

```bash
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _news.deinfra
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _base.deinfra
$ aws-vault exec recruit.nic.cheneweth --no-session -- make _backend-support.deinfra
```
